# Plant Care and Selection Web Application

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive web-based application designed for plant enthusiasts. It integrates various technologies and platforms to provide a user-friendly interface for plant care and selection. The key components of the project are outlined below:

### Backend (`app.py`)
The backend is developed in Python, utilizing the Flask framework. It features a range of functionalities including:
- Scheduling tasks with APScheduler.
- Hardware interfacing, potentially with Raspberry Pi, for real-time plant monitoring.
- Integration with Twilio for communication capabilities.
- Use of TensorFlow for advanced image processing or machine learning tasks.

### Computer Vision Notebook (`comp_vis.ipynb`)
This Jupyter Notebook is a crucial part of the project, focusing on computer vision. Its primary role is likely in the analysis and monitoring of plant health and growth, employing image processing and machine learning algorithms.

### Frontend (`form.html` and `index.html`)
The frontend consists of two HTML files:
- `form.html`: A user interface component for plant selection.
- `index.html`: The main page of the application, focused on providing plant care information and user interaction.

### Data (`plants.csv`)
The project uses a CSV file containing data about various plants and their ideal care conditions, such as humidity and temperature ranges. This data is essential for informing users about the specific needs of different plants.

## Usage Guide

This section provides an overview of how to use the application effectively:

### Navigating the Application
- **Home Page (`index.html`)**: This is the main landing page where users can find general information about plant care.
- **Plant Selection (`form.html`)**: Users can select different plants to learn about their specific care requirements.

### Interacting with the Backend
- The backend (`app.py`) handles data processing, scheduling tasks, and interfacing with hardware. Users can interact with it through the web interface.

### Using the Computer Vision Notebook (`comp_vis.ipynb`)
- The Jupyter Notebook can be used to process and analyze plant images. It's essential for tasks like disease detection or growth monitoring.

### Data Management (`plants.csv`)
- The CSV file contains vital information about various plants. Users can refer to this file for understanding the ideal care conditions for each plant.
